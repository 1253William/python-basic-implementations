##A variable represents a value in memory
##In python there's no need to declare the type, because it is an inferred-type by default though allowed,
# Hence python is dynamically type language

x = 3 ## here is an int variable
z = 3.1444 ## here is a float variable
y = "hello world" ## here is a str
y = 8 + 8 ## reassigning y to 16
name = "John" # str in double quotes
surname = 'Doe' # str in single quotes

print(x)
print(z)
print(y)
print(name)
